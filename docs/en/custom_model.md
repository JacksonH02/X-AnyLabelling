## 1. Loading Built-in Models

Currently, the built-in models in `X-AnyLabeling` are hosted on the GitHub release repository. Therefore, if you want to import a model directly from the GUI interface, it is essential to ensure a smooth internet connection; otherwise, you may encounter download failures.

For users who, due to network issues, are unable to download weight files smoothly from the interface, please refer to the [models_zoo.md](./models_zoo.md) to locate the corresponding weight file for the model you wish to load. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in [#23](https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling/issues/23) for a demonstration.


## 2. Loading Custom Models

### 2.1 Adapted Models

**Adapted Models** refer to network models that have already been adapted within X-AnyLabeling. Similarly, you can refer to the [models_zoo.md](./models_zoo.md) document. Taking the [yolov5s](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) model as an example, assuming a user has trained a custom `yolov5` detection model locally, you can download the corresponding [configuration file](../../anylabeling/configs/auto_labeling/yolov5s.yaml) as shown below:

```YAML
type: yolov5
name: yolov5s-r20230520
display_name: YOLOv5s Ultralytics
model_path: https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling/releases/download/v0.1.0/yolov5s.onnx
nms_threshold: 0.45
confidence_threshold: 0.25
classes:
  - person
  - bicycle
  - car
  - ...
```

A brief explanation of each field:

- `type`: Identifies the network type, providing a unique identifier for each model. This identifier is not user-modifiable.
- `name`: Defines the configuration file index marker for the current built-in model. If loading a user-defined model, this field may be left unset. For more details, refer to the [models.yaml](../../anylabeling/configs/auto_labeling/models.yaml) file.
- `display_name`: Used for the displayed name in the interface, customizable based on the specific task, such as `Fruits (YOLOv5s)`.
- `model_path`: Specifies the path to load the model weights. Note that this path is relative to the current configuration file. If necessary, you can also provide an absolute path. Ensure the file format is `*.onnx`.
- `nms_threshold`, `confidence_threshold`, and `classes` fields can be set according to the actual requirements. Additionally, `X-AnyLabeling` offers some auxiliary features, such as supporting `agnostic` and `filter_classes`. For example:

```YAML
type: yolov5
name: yolov5s-r20230520
display_name: YOLOv5s Ultralytics
model_path: https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling/releases/download/v0.1.0/yolov5s.onnx
nms_threshold: 0.45
confidence_threshold: 0.25
agnostic: True
filter_classes:
  - person
classes:
  - person
  - bicycle
  - car
  - ...
```

With the `filter_classes` setting, you can make the model detect only the `person` category, and the `agnostic` parameter is used to treat all objects as one category for NMS. Note that the current built-in model supports `yolov5` versions v6.0 and above. If you are using an older version like `v5.0`, be sure to specify the `anchors` and `stride` fields in the configuration file, as shown below:

```YAML
type: yolov5
...
stride: 32
anchors:
  - [10,13, 16,30, 33,23]  # P3/8
  - [30,61, 62,45, 59,119]  # P4/16
  - [116,90, 156,198, 373,326]  # P5/32
```

Now, we understand the role of configuration files in the entire `X-AnyLabeling`. Suppose a user has trained a `yolov5s` detection model for detecting `apple`, `banana`, and `orange` categories. First, convert the `*.pt` file to `*.onnx` format, obtaining a model weight file named `fruits.onnx`. 

> Note: After the transformation, make sure to open the model using [Netron](https://netron.app/) tool to ensure alignment between the input and output nodes of the model and the built-in model within X-AnyLabeling. This step is crucial for compatibility and seamless integration.

Next, copy the configuration file corresponding to the current model from [models_zoo.md](./models_zoo.md) to the local machine and modify the corresponding hyperparameter fields as needed, such as detection threshold and categories. For example:

```YAML
type: yolov5
name: yolov5s-r20230520
display_name: Fruits (YOLOv5s)
model_path: fruits.onnx
input_width: 640
input_height: 640
nms_threshold: 0.45
confidence_threshold: 0.45
classes:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
```

Then, create a new folder and place the weight file and the corresponding configuration file in the same directory:

```
|- custom_model
|   |- fruits.onnx
|   |- fruits_yolov5s.yaml
```

Finally, open the GUI interface, click the `Model Icon` button, select `...Load Custom Model` and choose the `fruits_yolov5s.yaml` configuration file to complete the loading of the custom model.

### 2.2 Unadapted Models

**Unadapted Models** refer to models not built into the X-AnyLabeling tool. Follow the steps below to integrate them quickly:

- Define the configuration file

Take `yolov5` as an example, referring to this [configuration file](../../anylabeling/configs/auto_labeling/yolov5s.yaml).

- Add to task management

Refer to this [file](../../anylabeling/configs/auto_labeling/models.yaml) for adding according to a unified format.

- Define the model file

The core of this step is to inherit the [models](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/model.py) class, implementing the corresponding pre-processing, model inference, and post-processing logic. Check an example for details.

- Add to model management

In the [model management file](../../anylabeling/services/auto_labeling/model_manager.py), add the newly defined custom model class.

- [HQ-SAM](https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq)

The recent Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a big leap in scaling up segmentation models, allowing for powerful zero-shot capabilities and flexible prompting. Despite being trained with 1.1 billion masks, SAM's mask prediction quality falls short in many cases, particularly when dealing with objects that have intricate structures. We propose HQ-SAM, equipping SAM with the ability to accurately segment any object, while maintaining SAM's original promptable design, efficiency, and zero-shot generalizability. Our careful design reuses and preserves the pre-trained model weights of SAM, while only introducing minimal additional parameters and computation. We design a learnable High-Quality Output Token, which is injected into SAM's mask decoder and is responsible for predicting the high-quality mask. Instead of only applying it on mask-decoder features, we first fuse them with early and final ViT features for improved mask details. To train our introduced learnable parameters, we compose a dataset of 44K fine-grained masks from several sources. HQ-SAM is only trained on the introduced dataset of 44k masks, which takes only 4 hours on 8 GPUs. We show the efficacy of HQ-SAM in a suite of 9 diverse segmentation datasets across different downstream tasks, where 7 out of them are evaluated in a zero-shot transfer protocol.
